# RapidReg - The WCA Registration System

This is the registration system for the World Cube Association and is currently
under development. For more info about the WCA visit the main repo [here](https://github.com/thewca/worldcubeassociation.org).

## How to run

### Running server locally

Run

```
docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up
```

The frontend will then be running at http://localhost:3002/.

### Running tests

If you are running tests for development purposes (ie you want to run them multiple times and check passes/fails), do the following:

1. Run the server locally (see instructions above)

2. Open a command prompt in the registration-handler container:

   2.1: Run `docker ps` and note the {container-id} of the wca_registration_handler (eg, "4ac2f5ba2a83")

   2.2: Run `docker exec -it {container-id} bash`

3. Inside the docker container, run `bundle exec rspec`

If you want to the test suite once-off, run

```
docker compose -f "docker-compose.test.yml" up wca_registration_handler --abort-on-container-exit
```

## Tests and API Docs

### Running Tests

Connect to the docker container, then use one of the following:

- All tests: `bundle exec rspec`
- A specific folder only: `bundle exec rspec spec/requests/registrations/{file-name}`
- Only success or fail tests in a specific file: `bundle exec rspec spec/requests/registrations/{file-name} -e "{success or fail}`

### RSwag and SwaggerUI

We use [RSwag](https://github.com/rswag/RSwag) to generate the API docs from the structure of our spec (test) files.

- `/swagger/v1` contains the `swagger.yaml` files which define our API spec.
- `swagger.yaml` is automatically generated when you run `rake rswag:specs:swaggerize` in the docker container (see "Running the tests" for instructions to run a command in the docker container)
- With the server running, you can go to localhost:/3001/api-docs to view the swagger-ui

_NOTE:_ Using RSwag can make test definitions appear convoluted. For example:

- You cannot stub requests with WebMock in a `response` block - you have to add a `context` block before the `response` block where the request is stubbed. If you have 4 consecutive tests with 4 different stubbed endpoints, you have to add a `context` block before each test defined in a `response`. It is annoying, but it is the price we pay for the convenience of RSwag

### Running certain tests only

Tests are grouped by "context" into success/fail groups. Add the `-e` flag to run tests matching search terms. So:

- To run success tests only: `bundle exec rspec -e success`
- To run failure tests only: `bundle exec rspec -e failure`
